Here are some ice elevation change rates for Glacier Bay, the Juneau icefield, and the Stikine icefield in SE Alaska. These are the files that I used as input to the REAR program to calculate elastic uplift rates. The format of the files is

N         longitude        latitude     disk-radius(in degrees)         dh/dt( in m/yr)

I also attached some GPS data for the region too in case you are interested.
